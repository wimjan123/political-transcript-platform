# Design Patterns and Guidelines

## Backend Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
- Database access abstracted through service layers
- SQLAlchemy models separate from business logic
- Async/await patterns for all database operations

### Dependency Injection
- FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system
- Database sessions injected into route handlers
- Configuration through environment variables

### Service Layer Pattern
- Business logic encapsulated in service classes
- Clear separation between API routes and business logic
- Examples: `ImportService`, `SummarizationService`

### Event-Driven Architecture
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Progress tracking through event emission
- Import status broadcasting to connected clients

## Frontend Design Patterns

### Component Composition
- Small, reusable components with single responsibilities
- Props-based component communication
- Higher-order components for shared behavior

### Custom Hooks Pattern
- Business logic extracted into custom hooks
- Reusable state management patterns
- API integration through React Query hooks

### Container/Presenter Pattern
- Page components orchestrate data fetching
- Presentation components focus on rendering
- Clear separation of concerns

### State Management
- React Query for server state management
- Local React state for UI state
- Context for cross-component shared state

## Database Design Principles

### Normalization
- Proper entity relationships with foreign keys
- Avoid data duplication where possible
- Use junction tables for many-to-many relationships

### Performance Optimization
- GIN indexes for full-text search
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Vector indexes for semantic search capabilities

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for data validation
- Proper null handling for optional fields

## API Design Guidelines

### RESTful Principles
- Resource-based URLs (`/api/videos`, `/api/search`)
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent response format structure

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses with Pydantic models
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

### Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated documentation
- Clear parameter descriptions and examples
- Response schema definitions

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Pydantic models for request validation
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- XSS protection through proper encoding

### Configuration Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Proper CORS configuration for development

## Performance Guidelines

### Backend Performance
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Database query optimization
- Proper connection pooling

### Frontend Performance
- Code splitting for large applications
- React Query caching for API responses
- Virtualization for large data sets

### Search Performance
- Meilisearch for fast full-text search
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Hybrid search combining multiple techniques
